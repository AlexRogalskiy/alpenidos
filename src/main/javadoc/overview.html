<h1>Diffy is a simple-easy library to provide the differences between any Java type objects.</h1>

<p>With the help of this library you can figure out the differences between the versions of an object or just simply compare the existing ones.</p>

<p>Based on a reflection mechanism to scan the object for fields and using the getters methods one can easily differentiate the values of the objects and get a collection of difference entries by a per-property slice.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Any object can be used despite the references dependency graph
    <li>Finds the differences between two objects
    <li>Returns the object's difference in an easy iterable structure
    <li>Requires no changes to your existing class hierarchy
    <li>Provides a simple configurable API
    <li>No extra runtime dependencies
</ul>

<p>jsoup is designed to deal with all varieties of HTML found in the wild; from pristine and validating,
    to invalid tag-soup; jsoup will create a sensible parse tree.</p>
